    "topic": "algebra",
    "solution": "## Step 1: Brief Concept Review\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of continuity in functions. A function is continuous if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pencil from the paper. This means that as we move from one part of the function to another, the values of the function should \"meet\" or match at the boundary points. In the case of a piecewise function like the one given, we need to ensure that the different parts of the function agree at the transition points, which are $x = 2$ and $x = -2$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Transition Points and Relevant Function Parts\nWe have two transition points: $x = 2$ and $x = -2$. At $x = 2$, the function transitions from $f(x) = x - 5$ to $f(x) = ax + 3$. At $x = -2$, the function transitions from $f(x) = x - 5$ to $f(x) = 2x - b$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Continuity at $x = 2$\nTo ensure the function is continuous at $x = 2$, we must have $f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3$ equal to $a(2) + 3 = 2a + 3$. This gives us the equation $2a + 3 = -3$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $a$\nSolving the equation $2a + 3 = -3$ for $a$, we subtract 3 from both sides to get $2a = -6$, and then divide both sides by 2 to find $a = -3$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Continuity at $x = -2$\nFor the function to be continuous at $x = -2$, we need $f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7$ to be equal to $2(-2) - b = -4 - b$. This gives us the equation $-4 - b = -7$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $b$\nSolving $-4 - b = -7$ for $b$, we add 4 to both sides to get $-b = -3$, and then multiply both sides by -1 to find $b = 3$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $a + b$\nNow that we have $a = -3$ and $b = 3$, we can find $a + b = -3 + 3 = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"

    "question": "What is the value of $9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1$?",
    "topic": "counting_and_probability",
    "solution": "## Step 1: Brief Concept Review\nThe given expression $9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1$ resembles the expansion of $(a + b)^3$, which is a key concept in algebra. This formula is $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$. Recognizing this pattern is crucial for simplifying the given expression.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a and b\nTo apply the formula, we need to identify $a$ and $b$. By comparing the given expression with the formula, it's clear that $a = 9$ and $b = 1$, because the given expression matches the pattern of $(a + b)^3$ when $a = 9$ and $b = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Formula\nNow, we substitute $a = 9$ and $b = 1$ into the formula $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$. This gives us $(9 + 1)^3 = 9^3 + 3(9^2)(1) + 3(9)(1^2) + 1^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the Expression\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get $10^3 = 9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1$. This means the given expression $9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1$ is equivalent to $10^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the Value\nTo find the value of $10^3$, we simply calculate $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1000}$"

    "question": "Square ABCD has its center at $(8,-8)$ and has an area of 4 square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. The square is then dilated with the dilation center at (0,0) and a scale factor of 2. What are the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square ABCD that is farthest from the origin? Give your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "topic": "geometry",
    "solution": "## Step 1: Brief Concept Review\nThe problem involves a square with a known center and area, which undergoes a dilation with a specified scale factor. The key concept here is understanding how dilations work in geometry. A dilation is a transformation that changes the size of a figure, but not its shape. In this case, the scale factor of 2 means that each point on the original square will move away from the origin (the center of dilation) to a new location that is twice as far from the origin as it was originally.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the Side Length of the Original Square\nGiven that the area of the square is 4 square units, we can find the side length of the square. The formula for the area of a square is side length squared (s^2). So, if the area is 4, then s^2 = 4, which means the side length (s) is 2 units.\n\n## Step 3: Find the Coordinates of the Vertices of the Original Square\nSince the center of the square is at (8, -8) and the side length is 2, and knowing that the top side of the square is horizontal, we can determine the coordinates of the vertices. The vertices will be 1 unit above, below, to the left, and to the right of the center. Therefore, the vertices are: (7, -9), (9, -9), (7, -7), and (9, -7).\n\n## Step 4: Identify the Vertex Farthest from the Origin\nTo find which vertex is farthest from the origin, we calculate the distance of each vertex from the origin using the distance formula: d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), where (x1, y1) is the origin (0,0) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the vertex. Calculating for each vertex: d1 = sqrt((7-0)^2 + (-9-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + 81) = sqrt(130), d2 = sqrt((9-0)^2 + (-9-0)^2) = sqrt(81 + 81) = sqrt(162), d3 = sqrt((7-0)^2 + (-7-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + 49) = sqrt(98), d4 = sqrt((9-0)^2 + (-7-0)^2) = sqrt(81 + 49) = sqrt(130). The vertex (9, -9) is farthest from the origin because it has the largest distance value.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Dilation to the Farthest Vertex\nThe dilation has a scale factor of 2 and is centered at the origin. To dilate a point, we multiply its coordinates by the scale factor. So, for the vertex (9, -9), the new coordinates after dilation will be (9*2, -9*2) = (18, -18).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(18, -18)}$"

Each number in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The principle that applies here is the understanding of how to calculate the values in Pascal's triangle and how to express them using binomial coefficients. The formula for the $i$th element in the $n$th row of Pascal's triangle is given by $\\binom{n}{i}$, which is equal to $\\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Expressing Elements of Pascal's Triangle Using Binomial Coefficients\nWe can express the elements of the 2005th, 2006th, and 2007th rows using binomial coefficients. For the 2005th row, the $i$th element is $\\binom{2005}{i}$. For the 2006th row, the $i$th element is $\\binom{2006}{i}$.

This is an arithmetic series with first term $\\frac{2007}{2007} = 1$, last term $\\frac{1}{2007}$, and $2007$ terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by $\\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. Therefore, the sum is $\\frac{2007(1 + \\frac{1}{2007})}{2} = \\frac{2007 \\cdot \\frac{2008}{2007}}{2} = \\frac{2008}{2} = 1004$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the Sum of $\\frac{a_i}{b_i}$\nTo calculate $\\sum_{i = 0}^{2005} \\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, we can express $\\frac{a_i}{b_i}$ in terms of binomial coefficients.

    "question": "If $AAA_4$ can be expressed as $33_b$, where $A$ is a digit in base 4 and $b$ is a base greater than 5, what is the smallest possible sum $A+b$?",
    "topic": "number_theory",
    "solution": "## Step 1: Brief Concept Review\nThe problem involves converting numbers between different bases. In base 4, the place values are powers of 4 (4^0 = 1, 4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16, etc.), and in base $b$, the place values are powers of $b$. The principle that applies here is the concept of place value and how to convert a number from one base to another.\n\n## Step 2: Express $AAA_4$ in Base 10\nTo compare $AAA_4$ and $33_b$, we need to express both in the same base. Let's start by converting $AAA_4$ to base 10. Since $A$ is a digit in base 4, $A$ can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The value of $AAA_4$ in base 10 is calculated as $A \\cdot 4^2 + A \\cdot 4^1 + A \\cdot 4^0 = 16A + 4A + A = 21A$.\n\n## Step 3: Express $33_b$ in Base 10\nNow, let's convert $33_b$ to base 10. The value of $33_b$ in base 10 is $3 \\cdot b^1 + 3 \\cdot b^0 = 3b + 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ in Base 10\nSince $AAA_4 = 33_b$, we can set their base 10 expressions equal to each other: $21A = 3b + 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider Possible Values for $A$ and $b$\nGiven that $A$ is a digit in base 4, $A$ can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. However, if $A = 0$, then $21A = 0$, which means $3b + 3 = 0$. This leads to $b = -1$, which is not valid since $b$ must be greater than 5. Therefore, $A$ cannot be 0. Let's consider the other possibilities for $A$.\n\n## Step 6: Test $A = 1$\nIf $A = 1$, then $21A = 21$. Setting this equal to $3b + 3$, we get $21 = 3b + 3$. Solving for $b$, we find $3b = 18$, which gives $b = 6$. Since $b = 6$ is greater than 5, this is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 7: Test $A = 2$\nIf $A = 2$, then $21A = 42$. Setting this equal to $3b + 3$, we get $42 = 3b + 3$. Solving for $b$, we find $3b = 39$, which gives $b = 13$. Although $b = 13$ is greater than 5, we need to check if this gives the smallest possible sum $A + b$.\n\n## Step 8: Test $A = 3$\nIf $A = 3$, then $21A = 63$. Setting this equal to $3b + 3$, we get $63 = 3b + 3$. Solving for $b$, we find $3b = 60$, which gives $b = 20$. Again, $b = 20$ is greater than 5, but we should compare the sum $A + b$ to the previous valid solutions.\n\n## Step 9: Compare Sums $A + b$\nWe have two valid solutions: $(A = 1, b = 6)$ and $(A = 2, b = 13)$. For $(A = 1, b = 6)$, $A + b = 1 + 6 = 7$. For $(A = 2, b = 13)$, $A + b = 2 + 13 = 15$. The smallest possible sum $A + b$ is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
